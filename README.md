*"yeah"*
I feel like you can use this word at any time with anyone.

If I could pick just one word I would have to use for the rest of my life, it would be "yeah."

In some cases, it's the better version of "yes." So if you need to answer any closed-ended questions, this can be your go-to response. If you need to say "no” or anything else, you're fu**d.

Or let's say you're having a conversation, and you jusť want the other person to know that you're listening. You can use it here as well.

If someone’s talking to you, and you’ve gotten distracted, just say “yeah.” Chances are, they won’t catch on that you weren’t fully tuned in. By answering "yeah" a few times, you could gain some time to figure out what the other person is talking about.

Or even if you understand the other person but can't come up with a clever response, this word is still a lifesaver. There are times when I’m nervous about speaking up. To avoid showing my nervousness, using "yeah" as a brief response is a handy way to handle any situation.

Basically, I wanted to say that this word is the go-to word for almost anything. Think of it like a basic attack in a video game - something you can use anytime without overthinking it.
