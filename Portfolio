Hi, I'm David. 22 yo VIDEO EDITOR from Czechia.
I'm not gonna lie. In terms of what I'm doing --> I'm kinda lost.
In the past year I had this "shiny object syndrome" - I was focusing on so many different things but actually achieved almost nothing. I was jumping from one thing to another and changing my trajectory all the time without actually taking much action.
You know... just researching stuff and then deciding to focus on something else. Then again, and again, ...
But i could divide my past few years into groups of main focus.
In 2020-2021 it was mostly 3D. So it means like 3D models, 3D animations etc. I'm working mainly in Blender but could work in other softwares like Maya, ZBrush and Substance Painter.
I wasn't making much money from it so the most money I made from 3D was selling this 3D commercial kitchen. Most of the stuff I created in 3D jsut just purely for fun. At that time I was having normal part time job and earning money from working on PC in a non creative way.

Then I decided to specialize on music videos. I was doing everything. So I directed it, shot it and edited it. But it wasnt making me much money. 
One example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGVgxuaHtSY&ab_channel=TEASE
Then I switched my focus on Youtube video. I was editing for big names like Hamza (2M+ subs) and Moon(not that Czech Moon but ytber from UK with 1M+ subs).

and recently I decided to focus on different things... and I'm still finding myself lol.
